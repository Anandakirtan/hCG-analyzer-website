# hCG analyzer

A website for analyzing hCG analyzes results. It uses conception date (which can be calculated using the last menstruation date) and hCG scores to tell if everything's alright or should scores should be higher lower.

Don't understand much about it, just implemented what my mom had always been doing by hand. **She says it saves her a lot of time!**

Very simple, but it does its job.
